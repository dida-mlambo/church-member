- Font styles
- Layout spacing

### Service Types
To add more service types, modify:
1. `app.py` - Update service type validation if needed
2. `static/index.html` - Add options to service type dropdown
3. `static/style.css` - Add badge styles for new types

## Backup

The SQLite database is stored in `church.db`. To backup your data:
```bash
cp church.db church_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```

## Troubleshooting

### Database Issues
If you encounter database errors, try:
```bash
rm church.db
python app.py  # This will create a fresh database
```

### Port Already in Use
If port 5000 is already in use, modify the last line in `app.py`:
```python
app.run(debug=True, port=5001)  # Change to any available port
```

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è This is a basic implementation suitable for internal church use. For production deployment:
- Add user authentication
- Implement access control
- Use HTTPS
- Add input validation and sanitization
- Use a production-grade database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Set `debug=False` in `app.py`
